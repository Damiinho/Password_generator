# Password generator

You can see this application [on this page](https://damiinho.github.io/Password_generator/) (via GitHub Pages).
The website should display well on any device.

## App description

This application allows you to create a new password from random characters (lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, symbols) from 4 to 16 characters long. The box "strength" shows the password strength (low, average, high) written in words and graphically (red, yellow and green bar). You can regenerate the password with the same settings by clicking the refresh button in the password box. If you want to copy the password, you can click on the "copy password" button.

## Technologies

Project created in React based on Create React App with TypeScript and styles written in SCSS. I used AppContext to handle states in functional components for the whole project and BEM naming convention for SCSS.
